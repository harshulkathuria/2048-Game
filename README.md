# 2048 Game (Python)

This is my first project on GitHub â€” a simple console-based implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game in Python.  
Use the keys W (up), A (left), S (down), D (right) to move the tiles and try to reach 2048!

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.  
2. Clone this repository or download the file.  
3. Run the program in your terminal:
   python 2048.py

## Features
- 4x4 grid just like the original 2048 game  
- Random tiles (2 or 4) appear after every move  
- Merge tiles with the same value  
- Simple text-based interface  

## Example Gameplay
```

|    | 2  |    |    |

enter your move :

## Future Ideas
- Add a score counter  
- Detect win/lose state  
- Maybe build a GUI version later
